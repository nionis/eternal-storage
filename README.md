# eternal-storage

Aims to provide a future proof storage.

There are multiple types of stores, for example Bytes32sStore, BoolsStore if you need all in one you can use contracts/EternalStore.sol.

There is also a managed eternal store where you have ability to disable people from using certain methods and / or keys.

Since the Eternal Storage standard has not been decided yet I am using this for my own projects.

Here is the [eternal storage standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/930) if you want to check it out.
