# eternal-storage

## in development

Aims to provide a future proof storage, work in progress!

Stores for each type are separated within contracts/stores, if you need all in one you can use contracts/EternalStore.sol.

There is also a managed eternal store where you have ability to disable people from using certain methods and / or valus keys.

Since the Eternal Storage standard has not been decided yet I am using this for my own projects.

Here is the [eternal storage standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/930) if you want to check it out.
